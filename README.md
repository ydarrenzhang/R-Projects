# R-Projects
R Portfolio showcasing several academic statistical projects I have done. In this repository the content is presented in the form of .R files. Data used in the projects are for demonstrative and educative purposes.

In order to set up, click on the R files for copying and pasting into your own R scripts. Please note that this portfolio is still a WIP, context and background information will be further added along with projects. Feel free to contact me for any inquires or discussion! You can contact me at ydarrenzhang@gmail.com.
