# R-Projects
R Portfolio showcasing several academic statistical projects I have done. In this repository the content is presented in the form of .R files. Data used in the projects are for demonstrative and educative purposes.

In order to set up, click on the R files for copying and pasting into your own R scripts. For inquires you can contact me at ydarrenzhang@gmail.com.
